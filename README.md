# ProxyTap
One-Tap iOS WiFi/Lan Proxy Switcher
Setting up a LAN proxy on an iPhone can be a hassle—you have to go into Settings to manually input the IP and port, especially when switching between normal networks and proxies.
To solve this pain point, I developed a handy iOS tool called ProxyTap. It automatically discovers proxy services on your LAN. For example, if the port is set to 8888, it will scan the LAN for Wi-Fi proxies using port 8888. Even if your computer switches networks and the LAN IP changes, there’s no need to update the IP—it auto-detects based on the port.
The app also supports widget integration, letting you link and switch proxies directly from the home screen or the -1 widget screen. No need to open the app—just one tap for a seamless, smooth experience. If you’re a client-side developer, this could save you 1–2 minutes every day!
The app is now available on the App Store. There are still areas for improvement, so your feedback and suggestions are highly welcome!
